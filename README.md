# Plant classifier model

I trained this model using fastai on a dataset of images downloaded from google. The dataset includes around 90 images for each of ~130 different species of common houehold plants. The classifier achieved an accuracy of ~70%, which is not terrible given the noisy nature of the data (automated google download, not curated by an expert) and the relatively small training set per image category

The code for making the app was referenced from [Fastai's github page](https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3)
